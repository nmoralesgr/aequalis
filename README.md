## File Overview

### ← README.md

This program should iprovide resources and bring light to the issues minority groups face in our current societal structure.
In the future I could fix the formatting on the page, as display through repl.it isn't transferred properly through other applications like vscode. This site is mainly informative, the action-taking part could not be completed within the time given. Finished MVP.
